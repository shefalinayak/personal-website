### Background

The Lamar Buffalo Ranch is part of Yellowstone National Park. The goal of the Lamar Energy Project (as I was involved with it) was to explain and showcase the ranch's sustainability efforts in the form of an energy dashboard with live data that visitors could explore and interact with.

This was a project I worked on for 8 weeks during the summer of 2016, through a PEI (Princeton Environmental Institute) internship. I spent 8 weeks in Bozeman, working with a team of Montana State University students and Yellowstone Park employees. I was brought on to really focus on the design/UI. It was important to have a website that was engaging to a variety of audiences, from children to energy experts.

### Tools / Technologies

The website is mostly HTML and CSS, with a bit of PHP thrown in. The charts were made with JavaScript, using the Google Charts API.

The charts get their data from a Heroku database. A script on a computer at the ranch gets the values from the IoT network of energy sensors and updates the database every fifteen minutes. The website itself is hosted on Montana State University's content management system.

I made the interactive map as an SVG file in Illustrator, and the System Overview is a GIF I made in Photoshop. All the photos were taken by us during visits to the ranch.

### Reflection

Apart from the most basic of the HTML and CSS, every part of this project was new. This was my first website! It was definitely a great learning experience, but there are lots of things I would do differently if I did this project today and I just wanted to mention that.
