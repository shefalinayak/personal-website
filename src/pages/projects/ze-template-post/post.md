# Markdown Review

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

or:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

or:

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

![flowers from media folder](./media/flowers.jpg)


If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway

There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```language-js
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
