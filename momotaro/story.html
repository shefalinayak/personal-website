	<p>Once upon a time, an old man and woman lived a simple life in a small Japanese village. The old man was a woodcutter, and every day he went to the hills to cut trees. While he was out, the old woman would do the housework and tend their small rice field. The couple lived alone—they had no children, and sometimes they felt very lonely.</p>
	<p>One day, the old woman was washing clothes in the river when she noticed a peach floating towards her. It wasn’t just any peach—this was a giant white peach, and it looked absolutely delicious. The old woman carried the peach back to the house. It was quite heavy, but it <em>was</em> a giant peach, and she was excited to share it with her husband.</p>
	<p>When the old man returned in the evening and saw the peach, he was just as excited as his wife. But just as he got ready to cut the peach in half, the peach suddenly split open on its own, revealing a baby boy inside!</p>
	<p>The boy explained that the gods sent him to this lonely couple to be their son.</p>
	<p>Delighted, the old man and woman took in the baby and raised him as their own. They named him Momotaro.</p>

	<p id="fast" class="optional">The years passed quickly, and Momotaro grew into a fine, 15-year-old boy. He was strong and tall.</p>
	<p id="really fast" class="optional">Momotaro grew up quickly. Really quickly, actually. If he ate one cup of rice, he grew one cup taller; if he ate two cups, he grew two cups taller. His growth probably slowed down after a while, but it wasn’t long before he was taller and stronger than the rest of the boys his age. Soon he was able to help his parents with everything from household tasks to mountain work.</p>

<section class="story">
	<p id="hero" class="optional">Momotaro’s parents raised him well, and by fifteen he was tall, strong, brave, handsome, kind-hearted, and wise for his years. His parents thought he seemed just like a hero ought to, so they shouldn’t have been too surprised at what happened next.</p>
	<p id="teen" class="optional">Most versions of the story will tell you that Momotaro was perfection itself, but most versions of the story are told to children by people who want Momotaro to be seen as a role model. Momotaro was certainly the strongest boy in the village, and his parents wanted him to have all the qualities of a hero, but he turned out to be quite lazy. He slept all day and didn’t really do much.</p>

<section class="story">
	<p id="volunteer" class="optional">Over time Momotaro had grown bored. He yearned for adventure, and as the threat of the demons loomed over the village, one day he approached his parents. “Thank you for raising me as your son,” he told them, “but I need to leave for the Island of Demons and defeat those that plague our land.”</p>
	<p id="voted" class="optional">Running out of options, the townspeople pushed Momotaro go fight the demons. If anyone could do it, he could.</p>
	<p>Momotaro’s parents were a little surprised, but also proud. The gods had sent Momotaro to them and they believed he was destined for great things. To prepare him for the journey, they made him a new kimono and a flag, and gave him a sword to fight with. Most importantly, they made him the most amazing, magical millet dumplings in Japan to take with him on his journey.</p>

	<p>Literally “Island of Demons”, Onigashima has a real-world counterpart called Megishima in the Sea of Japan. If you climb (or take a bus) all the way to the top, you can enter the demons’ cave.</p>

<div class="slide" id="kibidango">
<section class="info">
	<p>The Japanese name for millet dumplings is kibi-dango. Though they are advertised with their connection to the legend of Momotaro, the kibi-dango that Okayama is known for today is a sweet confection that uses little to no millet.</p>

<div class="section" id="part5">
<section class="story">
	<p>When he reached the outskirts of the village, Momotaro came across a dog. “Where are you going?” the dog asked him. “And, uh, what is that delicious-smelling stuff you’re carrying in that little bag?”</p>
	<p>Momotaro told him about his quest and the most amazing, magical millet dumplings he was carrying. The dog agreed to join him on his quest for the price of one millet dumpling.</p>

<section class="story">
	<p id="bff" class="optional">Momotaro and the dog continued along, and eventually they ran into a monkey, and then a pheasant. Like the dog, the monkey and pheasant both agreed to join Momotaro in exchange for a single millet dumpling. During the journey, the four companions told each other stories and played games and became good friends.</p>
	<p id="quarrel" class="optional">Momotaro and the dog continued along, and eventually they ran into a monkey. Like the dog, the monkey agreed to join Momotaro in exchange for one millet dumpling. However, dogs and monkeys don’t get along, and these two were a classic pair. In order to separate them, Momotaro had to send the dog ahead with his flag, and send the monkey behind him with a sword, so that he would be between them and they would not fight.</p>
	<p id="quarrel2" class="optional">The three of them then ran into a pheasant, much to the dislike of the dog and monkey. The dog immediately started fighting with the pheasant, but they were quite evenly matched and Momotaro was impressed. “Join us,” he said to the pheasant. “We are on our way to the defeat the demons.” The pheasant agreed—in exchange for one millet dumpling. So they journeyed on with the monkey behind, the dog ahead, and the pheasant flying above—in this way, Momotaro was able to keep the peace.</p>

	<p>Finally, Momotaro and his three friends reached the shore, where some demons had left a boat. The island wasn’t visible from this side of the sea, but they boarded the boat and the wind and the current took them straight to the island. On the Island of Devils, a large gate blocked the entrance to the fort.</p>

	<p id="A" class="optional">The monkey climbed up the gate and unlocked it from the inside, and the rest of the companions rushed in. Momotaro slashed at the demons with his sword, the pheasant pecked, the monkey scratched, and the dog bit.</p>
	<p id="B" class="optional">The pheasant flew inside and grabbed the key to unlock the gate. Momotaro, the dog, and the monkey rushed in. The pheasant pecked at the demons’ eyes, the dog bit their limbs, and the monkey jumped on them and scratched.</p>
	<p id="C" class="optional">The pheasant flew over the gate and pecked at the demons. The monkey climbed over the gate and scratched them. Momotaro and the dog rushed at the gate and forced their way inside.</p>
	<p id="D" class="optional">The pheasant flew over the gate and began to fight the demons. The other companions looking for another way in. As they walked up the path, they came across two girls crying as they washed clothes in the stream. The girls were captives of the Demon King, and they showed Momotaro a small back door in the castle wall. The door was tiny, but Momotaro and his friends made it through and began to battle the demons.</p>

	<p id="millet" class="optional">The millet dumplings gave each companion the power to fight with the strength of a hundred warriors, and they easily defeated all the demons (listen, kids—eat well so you can be as strong as Momotaro). Victorious, they approached the Demon King.</p>
	<p>Having just seen these great warriors defeat the rest of his demons, the Demon King immediately surrendered to Momotaro. “Please have mercy, o great warrior!” the Demon King cried. “Spare me, and I will return all the treasure and release my prisoners! I promise never to be wicked again!”</p>

	<p id="arson2" class="optional">However, when the demon child grew up, he escaped and returned to his island. Occasionally, he would cross the sea and set fire to Momotaro’s mansion. Apart from that, Momotaro and the old couple lived in peace and plenty to the end of their days.</p>
