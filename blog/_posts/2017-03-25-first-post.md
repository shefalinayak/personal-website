title: Finally up and running!
---
A little while ago, armed with only a rudimentary knowledge of HTML/CSS and a domain name that I had puchased on a whim, I embarked on my journey to make myself a personal website.

I hadn't taken a networks class yet, and I really knew nothing about the internet. I blindly followed some instructions from a very helpful blog post, and although I didn't understand what I was doing, I soon had a basic "Under Construction" page online. There was just one problem: I still didn't know how to use Github.

I understood the concept of version control and branches and merging _in theory_, so I thought this programmer's rite of passage was a just few tutorials away.

Mistake. When I finally downloaded GitHub Desktop, I realized I was being an idiot. The tutorials for Git via command-line felt like blindly typing commands because that's exactly what they were. I was being told that things were happening, but it was hard to understand. Part of me felt like a visual interface was a handicap, like any _real_ computer scientist ought to be able to run the world from the command line. But the desktop program has phenomenal visualizations that make everything instantly clear, and I obviously should have used it from the beginning.

So now I've learned about DNS records and Github and Jekyll and markdown, it feels so straightforward
